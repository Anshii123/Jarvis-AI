My dear brother, my closest friend,
A bond that will never bend.
Through thick and thin, we've stood tall,
In times of joy and times of fall.

You've been my guide, my rock, my light,
In the darkest of nights.
Your laughter, your smile, your gentle touch,
I'll treasure them so much.

You've taught me to be strong, to never give in,
To chase my dreams, to always win.
You've shown me the world, through your eyes so bright,
And filled my heart with pure delight.

My dear brother, my partner in crime,
I'll always cherish this special time.
Our memories, our love, will never fade,
A bond that will never be swayed.

I'm grateful for you, my one and only,
Our love will forever be sunny.
My dear brother, my heart's delight,
I'll love you till the end of time, tonight.
