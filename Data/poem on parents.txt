A poem for the ones who gave me life,
Who guided me through thick and thin,
Who held my hand when I was a child,
And wiped away my tears within.

A poem for the ones who taught me right,
From wrong, and how to stand tall,
Who showed me the way through the night,
And answered when I made the call.

A poem for the ones who worked so hard,
To give me all the things I need,
Who supported me with all their heart,
And helped me grow and succeed.

A poem for the ones who never left,
Even when I made mistakes,
Who stood by me and gave me breath,
And for all the love they make.

A poem for the ones who are my world,
My parents, the best that there are,
For them I'll be forever grateful,
And forever they will have a star.
