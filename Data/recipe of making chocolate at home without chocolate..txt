While it's not possible to make chocolate from scratch without cocoa beans, you can still create a delicious chocolate-like substance at home using ingredients that you likely already have in your pantry. Here's a simple recipe for making homemade chocolate without chocolate:

Ingredients:

* 1 cup of coconut oil
* 1/2 cup of cocoa powder
* 1/2 cup of honey or maple syrup
* 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
* A pinch of salt

Instructions:

1. Melt the coconut oil in a double boiler or a heatproof bowl set over a pot of simmering water.
2. Once the coconut oil is melted, remove it from the heat and whisk in the cocoa powder until it's fully incorporated.
3. Add the honey or maple syrup, vanilla extract, and salt to the mixture and stir until everything is well combined.
4. Pour the chocolate mixture into a mold or a lined baking sheet and refrigerate it for at least an hour, or until it's completely set.
5. Once the chocolate is set, remove it from the mold or baking sheet and break it into small pieces.
6. Enjoy your homemade chocolate as a snack, in a trail mix, or as a topping for ice cream or fruit.

Note: Coconut oil has a low melting point, so it's best to store your homemade chocolate in the refrigerator or freezer to keep it from melting. Additionally, you can customize this recipe by adding different spices, nuts, or dried fruit to the chocolate mixture before it sets.
