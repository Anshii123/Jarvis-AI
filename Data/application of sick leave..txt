Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to come to work for the next few days due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell and decided it would be best to see a doctor. After consulting with a medical professional, it has been determined that I need to take some time off to rest and recover.

I am sorry for any inconvenience this may cause and I will do my best to make up for any lost time when I return to work. I will keep you updated on my progress and let you know as soon as I am able to return.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,
Anshika Garg

Note: It is always best to check with your employer's policies regarding sick leave, as they may have specific procedures that need to be followed.
