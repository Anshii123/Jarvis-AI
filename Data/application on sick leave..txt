Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to inform you that I am unable to attend work today due to illness. I woke up this morning feeling unwell, and after assessing my symptoms, I have decided it would be best for me to stay home and rest.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will do my best to make up for the lost time as soon as I am feeling better. I will be monitoring my health closely and will keep you updated on my status.

Thank you for your understanding and please let me know if there is anything else I can do during this time.

Sincerely,
Anshika Garg
