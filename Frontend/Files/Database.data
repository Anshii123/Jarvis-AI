Anshika Garg:Jarvis bhole chature kaise banaen.
Jarvis:I see you're asking about making a traditional Indian snack, Jarvis Bhole Chature!
For those who may not know, Jarvis Bhole Chature is a popular savory snack from the state of Uttar Pradesh in India. It's a crispy, flavorful, and addictive snack made from a mixture of spices, herbs, and chickpea flour.
Here's a simple recipe to make Jarvis Bhole Chature at home:
Ingredients:
* 1 cup chickpea flour (besan)
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon asafoetida (hing)
* 1/4 teaspoon cumin seeds
* 1/4 teaspoon coriander seeds
* 1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds
* 1/4 teaspoon garam masala powder
* 1/4 teaspoon amchur powder (dried mango powder)
* 1/4 teaspoon red chili powder (optional, for some heat)
* 2 tablespoons ghee or oil
* Water, as needed
* Chopped fresh cilantro, for garnish
Instructions:
1. In a large mixing bowl, combine the chickpea flour, baking soda, salt, asafoetida, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, fennel seeds, garam masala powder, amchur powder, and red chili powder (if using).
2. Mix well to combine the dry ingredients.
3. Add the ghee or oil to the mixture and mix until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
4. Gradually add water to the mixture and knead it into a smooth dough. The dough should be soft but not too sticky. If needed, add a little more water or chickpea flour to achieve the right consistency.
5. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.
6. Divide the dough into small portions, about the size of a small lemon.
7. Roll out each portion into a thin circle, about 3-4 inches in diameter.
8. Heat a non-stick pan or griddle over medium heat. Place a rolled-out dough circle in the pan and cook for about 30 seconds on the first side, or until it starts to puff up and the edges start to curl.
9. Flip the chature over and cook for another 30 seconds, or until it's golden brown and crispy.
10. Repeat with the remaining dough portions.
11. Serve the Jarvis Bhole Chature hot with a sprinkle of chopped cilantro and a dollop of chutney or raita, if desired.
Enjoy your homemade Jarvis Bhole Chature!
